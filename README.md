# GitHub

GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on
projects from anywhere. GitHub is home to more than 40 Million developers, You can work on GitHub for your personal
or public project from anywhere. GitHub works with version control system `git`. 

>> ### What is `git`? 
>> `Git` is an open-source version control system that was  started by Linus Torvalds—the same person who created Linux.
Git is similar to other version control systems—Subversion, CVS, and Mercurial to name a few. Version control systems 
keep these revisions straight, storing the modifications in a central repository. This allows developers to easily 
collaborate, as they can download a new version of the software, make changes, and upload the newest revision. 
Every developer can see these new changes, download them, and contribute.
